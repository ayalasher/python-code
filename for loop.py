#Here , we are going to look into a for loop example
# we are having a theory that 0 is the first number .
# when "1" has been placed in the parenthesis it means that  1 number will be printed starting fdrom zero 
# when "5" has been placed in the parenthesis it means that  5 numbers will be printed starting fdrom zero 

for index in range (4,10,2) :
    print(index)
